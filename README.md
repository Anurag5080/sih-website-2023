This website is completely designed and developed by me as we have the problem statement of waste management for SIH'23. We have to give software solution for that problem So we(our team) discussed and finally designed a best idea throw which we can manage the industrial waste very effectively and connect the government bodies to local bodies and private NGO's. In this website we have special feature that any individual can complain about the unwanted waste dumping and all and this complain goes to the nearest Muncipal corporation and also status is managed online which can access by government. Along with all of these we also focus on educating peoples about the diseases happens through the wastes and the actual harmness due to waste so people take major steps to avoid that and for this special purpose we include quiz gaming feature which also helps to giving good knowledge to people through a funny way. Also the private NGO's can come and collab to host big cleaning drives events, people come and post about their views in blog section and much more...
